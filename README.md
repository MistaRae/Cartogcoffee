#MVP:

our app must display educational content regarding coffee:

  - a map API will display points of interest in the 'coffee world', such as countries that are major producers/consumers. 
  - a drop down menu to filter by region 
  - educational tooltips which provide the user with information on coffee from that specific region 
  
#EXTENSIONS:

  - add additional filter criteria
  - zoom to filtered region 
  - include a section on preperation instructions
  - add a choropleth to the map to display coffee production/consumption in each country 
  - additional styling
  
#INSTRUCTIONS:

  -  from CLIENT directory install required packages: npm install 
  -  from SERVER directory install required packages: npm install 
  -  from SERVER directory seed mongodb database: npm run seeds
  -  from SERVER directory spin up the development server: npm run server:dev
  -  from CLIENT directory spin up the react server: npm start 
  -  if this doesnt open your browser automatically, open up a new window on localhost:3000
  -  we recomend CHROME as this is what it was designed in.
