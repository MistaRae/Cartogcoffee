#MVP:

our app must display educational content regarding coffee:

  - a map API will display points of interest in the 'coffee world', such as countries that are major producers/consumers. 
  - a drop down menu to filter by region 
  - educational tooltips which provide the user with information on coffee from that specific region 
  
#EXTENSIONS:

  - add additional filter criteria
  - zoom to filtered region 
  - include a section on preperation instructions
  - add a cloropleth to the map to display coffee production/consumption in each country 
  - additional styling
